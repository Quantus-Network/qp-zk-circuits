  Deterministic cores of the whitepaper's reduction-style security theorems.

  The paper states these as game-based reductions to *computational* hardness:
  collision resistance (`one-time withdrawal`, §4.2) and preimage resistance
  (`spend-path exclusivity`, §4.3). We follow that shape literally: each result has

    * a **reduction** form (`*_or_collision`), provable for *any* `H` with no
      assumption — "if the scheme breaks, here is an explicit collision in `H`";
    * a **corollary** under the explicit `CollisionResistant ro` hypothesis, which
      eliminates the collision branch and recovers the clean structural conclusion:
        - collision resistance ⇒ derivations are injective, so "same deposit ⇒ same
          nullifier" (hence two distinct nullifiers cannot come from one deposit);
        - preimage resistance ⇒ the wormhole address has a *unique* outer preimage,
          the structured inner value `H(salt_wh ‖ s)` — the paper's case (2)
          collapses into case (1), there is exactly one spend path.

  Splitting the assumption out of `RandomOracle` (see `Hash.lean`) is what lets the
  oracle be instantiated by the concrete finite-field sponge: the reductions survive
  a compressing `H`, and collision resistance is invoked only at the corollary.

  The probabilistic accounting (the `ε_coll`/`ε_pre` terms and the
  knowledge-soundness extractor) is the Phase-4 game-based track, out of scope here.

/-- **One-time withdrawal core** (§4.2): a deposit determines its nullifier.
    Both proofs in the double-spend game reference the same deposit, so they share
    the wormhole address (`haddr`, collision resistance forces the same secret)
    and the same ZK-tree counter (`hc`, the counter is part of the authenticated
    leaf); hence the nullifiers coincide. The game's winning requirement
    `n₁ ≠ n₂` is therefore unsatisfiable. -/

/-- **Spend-path exclusivity core** (§4.3): the *only* preimage of a wormhole
    address `WA(s)` under the outer hash is the structured inner value
    `H(salt_wh ‖ s)`. Any `pk` the adversary controls with `H(pk) = WA(s)` must
    equal it, so the paper's case (2) ("some other `pk`") collapses into case (1).
    Combined with `|pk| > |H|` for post-quantum keys (case (1) is then
    impossible), there is no spend path other than knowing `s`. -/

/-! ### Payoff: the oracle is now inhabited by *non-injective* hashes.

    With the old `injective` field this section would not type-check — you cannot build
    a `RandomOracle` from a compressing hash. Now `RandomOracle` is just `H`, so it
    admits any hash, including the concrete finite-field Poseidon2 sponge
    (`Plonky2Spec.Sponge.H`, Step 3c), which a future adapter package can drop in as
    `{ H := … }`. The security theorems apply to *every* such oracle via the
    `*_or_collision` reductions; they need `CollisionResistant` only for the clean
    corollaries — which a compressing hash genuinely fails, as below. -/
namespace Demo

/-- A maximally-compressing oracle: every preimage maps to the zero digest. It inhabits
    `RandomOracle` despite being the opposite of injective. -/
def collapsingRO : RandomOracle := { H := fun _ => Digest.zero }

/-- It is honestly *not* collision-resistant — so the reductions above are non-vacuous:
    `[]` and `[0]` are a collision. -/
example : ¬ collapsingRO.CollisionResistant := fun cr =>
  absurd (cr [] [0] rfl) (by decide)

/-- And the reduction *constructs* a collision: two distinct secrets share the
    (degenerate) wormhole address, so `WA_inj_or_collision` must return the collision
    disjunct (the equality disjunct is impossible — the secrets differ). -/
example : HasCollision collapsingRO.H := by
  rcases collapsingRO.WA_inj_or_collision (s := Digest.zero) (s' := ⟨1, 0, 0, 0⟩) rfl with
    heq | hcol
  · exact absurd heq (by decide)   -- `Digest.zero = ⟨1,0,0,0⟩` is false: the secrets differ
  · exact hcol                     -- the reduction handed us the collision in `H`
